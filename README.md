# Cyberberbullying-TextClassification-NLP

This project involves solving a cyber-bullying detection problem using the "twitter_parsed tweets" dataset. The dataset is a collection of text data from various social media platforms, such as Kaggle, Twitter, Wikipedia Talk pages, and YouTube. Each data instance is labeled as either bullying or non-bullying. The cyber-bullying types include hate speech, aggression, insults, and toxicity. The main objective is to classify tweets as toxic or non-toxic, thereby contributing to the automatic detection of cyber-bullying in social media content.
